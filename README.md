# summarize_geoproject_contents

A collection of tools to summarise the contents of an mxd, aprx or map file into xlsx to create a more human-readable
overview.

The output xlsx lists data sources and basic visualisation settings, such as group names, max. and min. scale,
visibility and visualisation attributes. For aprx it uses basic cim properties.

A Python Toolbox for calling the two Esri tools is included for convenience.
